# DAFNet_TIP20
Code and result repository for our paper:

Qijian Zhang, Runmin Cong#, Chongyi Li, Ming-Ming Cheng, Yuming Fang, Xiaochun Cao, Yao Zhao, and Sam Kwong, Dense attention fluid network for salient object detection in optical remote sensing images, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, vol. 30, pp. 1305-1317, 2021..


## The useage of the DAFNet_code:
- The training and testing pipeline is organized in run.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook).
- The evaluation code (python) is modified from this repository: https://github.com/zzhanghub/eval-co-sod. 
  You can simply enter the "./Evaluation" folder and run the "main.py" file to obtain 1) MAE; 2) F-measure; 3) S-measure.


## The proposed Dataset:
- EORSSD dataset: https://github.com/rmcong/EORSSD-dataset
- ORSSD dataset: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1k44UlTLCW17AS0VhPyP7JA


## Results:
- Our results can be found in the file of ./DAFNet_result.zip
- The results of thecomparison methods in our paper can be download at BaiduYun: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1R9fSkqoR2uJficHDxhIs4A (code: MVPL)
